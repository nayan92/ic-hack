How to uninstall from device

2. Uninstall from the command prompt by running the following.

```
‚ùØ adb devices
List of devices attached

```

Choose the non-emulator device for the following:

```
adb -s 015DA77214005014 uninstall com.sat.sonata
```

Running the java program which reads image and produces MIDI file
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Enter the directory OpenOMR
```
cd OpenOMR
```
2. Compile the java files
```
javac -classpath lib/joone-engine.jar:lib/jcommon-1.0.22.jar::lib/jfreechart-1.0.2.jar openomr/openomr/CreateMidiForImage.java
```
3. Run the class CreateMidiForImage (Change the final argument to the picture you desire)
```
java -classpath lib/joone-engine.jar:lib/jcommon-1.0.22.jar:.:lib/jfreechart-1.0.2.jar -Xmx256m openomr/openomr/CreateMidiForImage testImages/demo/scale.png
```
4. The output will be stored as a file named nayanmidifile.mid in the directory OpenOMR. Will be made configurable soon. You can now play this with your favorite MIDI player.


Enjoy!!
